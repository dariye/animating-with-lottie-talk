Howdy! I would like to welcome you all to Pleo.
My name is Paul.
I work as a frontend engineer at Pleo.

# Overview

- On animations
- Animating with Lottie

<Notes>
Today’s talk is about animations. Specifically, animating with a not-so-new-kid-on-the-block, Lottie. 
</Notes>

---

✋🏼✋✋🏾✋🏻✋🏽✋🏿

<Notes>
Just for a show of hands, how many of you have implemented an animation on the frontend (can be CSS transitions, SVG animations, etc?
How many of you have heard of Lottie before today? How many of you have used Lottie?
</Notes>

❓

---

<Layout>Animations are great because they provide additional context for our users,</Layout>

---

<Layout>...in hopefully ways that are delightful and meaningful.</Layout>

---

<Layout>...they add a body language to your product that users can be at ease with and give your brand character.</Layout>

<Notes>
Think about those micro interactions in your favorite app. For example when you get a like on Tinder
</Notes>

Animation patterns

- Transitions
- Supplements
- Feedback
- Demonstrations
- Decorations

<Notes>
Rachel Nabors breaks this down from her book Animation at Work.
</Notes>

---

## Transitions

---

<Layout>Can you tell users where they have been, where they are going and where they are?</Layout>

---

<LiveEdit code={transitionCode} noInline />

---

# Supplements

---

<Layout>Can you provide additional or new information regarding the state of the application that provides more context?</Layout>

---

<LiveEdit code={supplementsCode} noInline />

---

# Feedback

---

<Layout>What happens when the user interacts with the interface?</Layout>

---

<LiveEdit code={feedbackCode} noInline />

---

# Demonstrations

---

<Layout>Can you save the the user time by showing them how something works or how something is done instead of telling them?</Layout>

---

<FullScreenCode>
{/* <Image src="static/illustration.svg" size="100%" /> */}
</FullScreenCode>

<Notes>
I used a tool called Termtosvg to generate this one and..

(If you’re curious, the others were created with react-spring)

Remember this?

# A simple fact

---

# 💣

---

Implementing animations can be a colossal PITA.

<Notes>
  And yes, even though we’re still in the 21st century and have some amazing technology, it is still time consuming to come up with animations that are smooth and performant (and sensible). Tools like Adobe After Effect make it a lot more accessible for anyone who can afford the software and manage to spend enough time with it to create truly amazing pieces.

 So what happens when we want to bring these amazing animations to life? What happens when we’re tasked to bring these delightful experiences and visuals into our apps and websites?
</Notes>

---

<Layout>...like most things, it depends</Layout>

--- 

<Image src="static/css-transition.gif" size="500px"/>

<Notes>
What runs through your mind when your designer presents you with an animation like this implement?
</Notes>

---

# JS + HTML + CSS

<Notes>
This is a React meetup, so I imagine that most people are familiar with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
</Notes>

---

<Image src="static/boy-reading.gif" size="500px"/>

<Notes>
  However, how do you implement this if you were to code it up?
</Notes>

---

# 🤯 

<Notes>
Possible?
</Notes>

---

Can you answer these?

- Does it add additional context to the user?
- How much value add to the user experience?
- Have you considered accessibility?
- How does it impact performance?
- Do you need these animations across platforms?
- How long will it take you to implement it?

<Notes>
- As stewards of the interface of technology, maybe we should always start by asking why?
- These are only a few questions you can ask to know if its worth investing the time to implement the animation. Once you have a satisfactory answer you can venture into the next step.

# Say hello, Lottie!

<Notes>
Lottie is a library created by Airbnb that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as JSON. It uses a plugin called Bodymovin created Hernan Torrisi. 
</Notes>

# 👩🏼‍🏭

Named after (Char)Lotte Reiniger

<Notes>
Fun fact, Lottie is named after (Char)Lotte Reiniger, a pioneer of silhouette animation. She created the first full-length animated film titled the Adventures of Prince Achmed created in 1923 and 1926. You can check out the documentary the Art of Lotte Reiniger on Youtube. 
</Notes>

---

<FullScreenCode>
<Image src="static/adventures-of-achmed.gif" />
</FullScreenCode>

<Notes>
  Silhouette films are notoriously challenging to make (I would know, I’ve never made one). Back in Lotte Reiniger’s days, characters had to be cutout by hand and individuals frames photographed. There was tremendous effort going into making these cardboard cutouts life-like characteristics. 
</Notes>

---

<Layout>Lottie makes it 🤬 easy to add these beautiful animations on 🍎 (iOS) 🤖 (Android), 🖥 (windows), and 🌏 (web).</Layout>

---

<LiveEdit code={`<Lottie name='pop-one' width='50%' height='auto' style={{backgroundColor: 'black'}}/>`} />

<Notes>
  Something "simple" your motion designer came up with to make the reaction of the button "pop"
</Notes>

---

<LiveEdit code={`<Lottie name='pop-two' width='50%' height='auto' style={{backgroundColor: 'black'}}/>`} />

<Notes>
A "subtle" variant
</Notes>

---

You need three things:

- Adobe After Effects
- LottieFiles plugin
- Lottie library

<Notes>
Or Bodymovin by Hernan Torrisi

Trust me, you probably want to leave designing/creating the animation to your motion designer. Here’s what I came up with when I gave it a try.

Do you want to see what I came up with in 30 minutes?
</Notes>

---

<LiveEdit code={`<Lottie name='howdy' width='50%' height='auto' style={{backgroundColor: 'black'}}/>`} />

<Notes>
Something like this is simple enough to achieve with just CSS transitions and transforms.
</Notes>

---

<Layout>How do these three tools all tie together into a workflow?</Layout>

<Notes>
Jump into Adobe After Effects 

- Show Howdy! composition
- Show Pop compositions

So, like Lotte Reiniger spending quite a lot of time creating her masterpieces, our motion designer spends countless hours ensuring that Pleo can communicate in a more delightful and approachable way to our users, potential users, and to the world. 
</Notes>

---

<Layout>My job, like yours, is to make these experiences accessible to users where they are.</Layout> 

--- 

<Layout>What you get by using Lottie?</Layout>

<Notes>
- Design in After Effect, use everywhere
- "Use exactly what the designer intended, exactly how it was made" (excerpt from airbnb's blog post)
- Increased flexibility and malleability of animation objects

<Layout>Lottie gives you some powerful controls and access animation frames</Layout>

---

<LiveEdit code={`<Lottie name='pop-one' width='50%' height='auto' style={{backgroundColor: 'black'}}/>`} />

<Notes>
 The API allows you to do the following: 
- Example with React Native
- Example with Vanillajs 
- Remember these slides are in React!
</Notes>

---

Also, toolings FTW! 🔥

- [You can preview your lottie animations](https://lottiefiles.com/preview)
- [You can debug your lottie JSON](https://lottiefiles.com/tools/json-editor)
- [You can try the online editor](https://lottiefiles.com/editor)

---

<Layout>
In the end, you get to focus on the user’s interaction with the interface,
</Layout>

---

<Layout>...and react accordingly with the visuals that add delight and joy 💅</Layout>

<Notes>
In the end though, you’re not messing with anything you’re not familiar with, example figuring out durations, timings, etc. You get to focus on the user’s interaction with the interface, and react accordingly (no pun intended) with the visuals that add delight and joy.

✂️ 🌹 

- Performance, performance, performance
- Doesn't yet support all the features of Adobe After Effect
- Debugging can be challenging

---

<Image src="static/with-great-power-gif.gif" size="90%" />

<Notes>
So, I hope I’ve sold you on why you should at least give Lottie a try if you aren’t already doing so.
</Notes>

---

To summarize,

- Use animations to add additional context
- Use  animations to delight your users
- Use animations to give your product a body language
- Use animations to give your brand character
- Use animations only when it makes sense

---

Lottie can help you with all of these and more!
