# Animating with Lottie [Add animation]

---

# I'm Paul 👽

---

# Can we answer the following?

- Why animations and do they matter?
- What is Lottie?
- Why consider Lottie?

---

# Why animations and why they matter?

---

Animations is for adding context.

Additionally, they

- add delight
- give character to our application

---

## Animation patterns

---

### 1. Transitions

---

Can you tell them where they have been, where they are going and where they are?

---

<LiveEdit code={`<TransitionDemo />`} />

---

### 2. Supplements

---

Can you provide additional or new information regarding the state of the application that provides more context?

---

<LiveEdit code={`<SupplementsDemo />`} />

---

### 3. Feedback

---

What happens when the user interacts with the interface?

---

<LiveEdit code={`<FeedbackDemo />`} />

---

### 4. Demonstrations

---

Can you save the the user time by showing them how something works or how something is done instead of telling them?

---

Demo

<DemonstrationsDemo />

---

### 5. Decorative animations

---

Can you delight the user even when they're just staring at an empty state or a loading state?

---

<LiveEdit code={`<DecorativeDemo />`} />

---

# Animate all the things, you say?

---

<Image src="./cat.gif" />

---

# But...

- Does it add additional context to the user?
- How much value add to the user experience?
- Have you considered accessbility?
- How do you share animations across platforms?
- How long will it take you to implement it?

---

# Say hello, Lottie

---

<LiveEdit code={`<Lottie name='busy' width='50%' height='auto' />`} />

---

Lottie is a library that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as JSON. It's available for Android, iOS, Web, React Native, and Windows

---

## What you need

1.  The Bodymovin or LottieFiles Plugin for AfterEffects
2.  Adobe AfterEffects

---

How does it all work?

---

## So, what is the future that Lottie is trying to realize?

---

- Design in After Effect, use everywhere
- "Use exactly what the designer intended, exactly how it was made" (excerpt from airbnb's blog post)
- Increased flexiblity

---

### Design in After Effect, use everywhere

In this reality, we let the motion designers do their thing. And their thing it turns out is Adobe After Effects

---

Demo

---

### "Use exactly what the designer intended, exactly how it was made" (excerpt from airbnb's blog post)

---

Demo

---

### Increased flexiblity

- Universal format
- Animation playback control

---

## Are there any drawbacks?

---

- Performance, performance, performance
- Doesn't yet support all the features of After Effect

---

For example,

---

## Recommendations

- Lazy load animated component using react-loadable or something similar

---

# Questions?

# Thank you
