# Animations

--- 

Animations is for adding context

---

## Animation patterns

---

### 1. Transitions

---

Can you tell them where they have been, where they are going and where they are?

--- 

<TransitionDemo />

---

<LiveCode
  title="How to greet people"
  size="small"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./transition-demo.jsx')}
/>

---

### 2. Supplements

---

Can you provide additional or new information regarding the state of the application that provides more context?

--- 

---

### 3. Feedback

---

What happens when the user interacts with the interface?

---

---

### 4. Demonstrations

---

Can you save the the user time by showing them how something works or how something is done instead of telling them?

---


--- 

### 5. Decorative animations

---

Can you delight the user even when they're just staring at an empty state?

---


--- 

# Animate all the things, you say?

- Does it add additional context to the user?
- How much value add to the user experience?
- Have you considered accessbility?
- How do you share animations across platforms?
- How long will it take you to implement it?
