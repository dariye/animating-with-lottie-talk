# Animating with Lottie

---

# I'm Paul ðŸ‘½

# Overview

- A brief chat on animations
- A peek into what's possible with Lottie

---

# Animations

---

Animations is for adding context

---

## Animation patterns

---

### 1. Transitions

---

Can you tell them where they have been, where they are going and where they are?

---

<LiveEdit code={`<TransitionDemo />`} />

---

### 2. Supplements

---

Can you provide additional or new information regarding the state of the application that provides more context?

---

<LiveEdit code={`<SupplementsDemo />`} />

---

### 3. Feedback

---

What happens when the user interacts with the interface?

---

<LiveEdit code={`<FeedbackDemo />`} />

---

### 4. Demonstrations

---

Can you save the the user time by showing them how something works or how something is done instead of telling them?

---

<DemonstrationsDemo />

---

### 5. Decorative animations

---

Can you delight the user even when they're just staring at an empty state or a loading state?

---

<LiveEdit code={`<DecorativeDemo />`} />

---

# Animate all the things, you say?

- Does it add additional context to the user?
- How much value add to the user experience?
- Have you considered accessbility?
- How do you share animations across platforms?
- How long will it take you to implement it?

---

# Say hello, Lottie

---

<LiveEdit code={`<Lottie name='busy' width='50%' height='auto' />`} />

---

## How it works

---

## So, what is the future that Lottie is trying to realize?

---

- Design in After Effect, use everywhere
- "use exactly what the designer intended, exactly how it was made" (excerpt from airbnb's blog post)

---

---

## Are there any drawbacks?

---

- Performance, performance, performance

---

## Recommendations

- Lazy load animated component using react-loadable or something similar

---

# Questions?

---

# Thank you
