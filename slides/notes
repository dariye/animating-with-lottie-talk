<Notes>
Things we can animate
- Position / Location (translate / rotate / box-shadow)
- Form / shape (scale / change shape)
- Color (opacity / color)
</Notes>

<Notes>What happens when the user moves from one location to another? What happens when they're done with a task? </Notes>


<Notes>
These are ancillary to the application. They are non obstrusive and don't attract information.
</Notes>

<Notes>
Lottie tries to solve some of these but some remain to be answered by your team and problem you're looking to solve by introducing animations.
