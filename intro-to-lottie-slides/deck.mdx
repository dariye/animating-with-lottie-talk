# Overview

- On animations
- Animating with Lottie

---

✋🏼✋✋🏾✋🏻✋🏽✋🏿

---

❓

---

<Layout>Animations are great because they provide additional context for our users,</Layout>

---

<Layout>...in hopefully ways that are delightful and meaningful.</Layout>

---

<Layout>...they add a body language to your product that users can be at ease with and give your brand character.</Layout>

<Notes>
Think about those micro interactions in your favorite app. For example when you get a like on Tinder
</Notes>

Animation patterns

- Transitions
- Supplements
- Feedback
- Demonstrations
- Decorations

<Notes>
Rachel Nabors breaks this down from her book Animation at Work.
</Notes>

---

## Transitions

---

<Layout>Can you tell users where they have been, where they are going and where they are?</Layout>

---

<LiveEdit code={transitionCode} noInline />

---

# Supplements

---

<Layout>Can you provide additional or new information regarding the state of the application that provides more context?</Layout>

---

<LiveEdit code={`<SupplementsDemo />`} />

---

# Feedback

---

<Layout>What happens when the user interacts with the interface?</Layout>

---

<LiveEdit code={feedbackCode} noInline />

---

# Demonstrations

---

<Layout>Can you save the the user time by showing them how something works or how something is done instead of telling them?</Layout>

---

# Decorative

---

---

<Notes>
I used a tool called Termtosvg to generate this one and..

(If you’re curious, the others were created with react-spring)
</Notes>

Remember this?

---

<Layout>If you're like me, you're probably going like wahhht...</Layout>

---

<Image src="static/cute-cat.gif" size="500px" />

---


# A simple fact

---

# 💣

---

Implementing animations can be a colossal PITA.

---

<Layout>...like most things, it depends</Layout>

--- 

<Image src="static/css-transition.gif" size="500px"/>

---

# JS + HTML + CSS

---

<Image src="static/boy-reading.gif" size="500px"/>

---

# 🤯 

<Notes>
Possible?
</Notes>

---

Can you answer these?

- Does it add additional context to the user?
- How much value add to the user experience?
- Have you considered accessibility?
- How does it impact performance?
- Do you need these animations across platforms?
- How long will it take you to implement it?

# Say hello, Lottie!

<Notes>
Lottie is a library created by Airbnb that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as JSON. It uses a plugin called Bodymovin created Hernan Torrisi. 
</Notes>

# 👩🏼‍🏭

Named after (Char)Lotte Reiniger

<Notes>
Lottie is named after (Char)Lotte Reiniger, a pioneer of silhouette animation. She created the first full-length animated film titled the Adventures of Prince Achmed created in 1923 and 1926. You can check out the documentary the Art of Lotte Reiniger on Youtube. 
</Notes>

---

<FullScreenCode>
<Image src="static/adventures-of-achmed.gif" />
</FullScreenCode>

<Notes>
  Silhouette films are notoriously challenging to make (I would know, I’ve never made one). Back in Lotte Reiniger’s days, characters had to be cutout by hand and individuals frames photographed. There was tremendous effort going into making these cardboard cutouts life-like characteristics. 
</Notes>

---

<Layout>Lottie makes it 🤬 easy to add these beautiful animations on 🍎 (iOS) 🤖 (Android), 🖥 (windows), and 🌏 (web).</Layout>

---

<LiveEdit code={`<Lottie name='pop-one' width='50%' height='auto' style={{backgroundColor: 'black'}}/>`} />

<Notes>
  Something "simple" your motion designer came up with to make the reaction of the button "pop"
</Notes>

---

<LiveEdit code={`<Lottie name='pop-two' width='50%' height='auto' style={{backgroundColor: 'black'}}/>`} />

<Notes>
A "subtle" variant
</Notes>

---

You need three things:

- Adobe After Effects
- LottieFiles plugin
- Lottie library

<Notes>
Bodymovin by Hernan Torrisi
</Notes>

---

<LiveEdit code={`<Lottie name='howdy' width='50%' height='auto' style={{backgroundColor: 'black'}}/>`} />

---

<Layout>How do these three tools all tie together into a workflow?</Layout>

---

<Layout>My job, like yours, is to make these experiences accessible to users where they are.</Layout> 

--- 

<Layout>What you get by using Lottie?</Layout>

---

# Design in After Effect, use everywhere

---

# Use exactly what the designer intended, exactly how it was made

---

# Increased flexibility and malleability of animation objects

---

Lottie has a pretty aggressive list of features

<Layout>Lottie gives you some powerful controls and access animation frames</Layout>

---

<LiveEdit code={`<Lottie name='pop-one' width='50%' height='auto' style={{backgroundColor: 'black'}}/>`} />

<Notes>
 The API allows you to do the following: 
- Example with React Native
- Example with Vanillajs 
- Remember these slides are in React!
</Notes>

---

Also, toolings FTW! 🔥

- [You can preview your lottie animations](https://lottiefiles.com/preview)
- [You can debug your lottie JSON](https://lottiefiles.com/tools/json-editor)
- [You can try the online editor](https://lottiefiles.com/editor)

---

<Layout>
In the end, you get to focus on the user’s interaction with the interface,
</Layout>

---

<Layout>...and react accordingly with the visuals that add delight and joy 💅</Layout>

<Notes>
In the end though, you’re not messing with anything you’re not familiar with, example figuring out durations, timings, etc. You get to focus on the user’s interaction with the interface, and react accordingly (no pun intended) with the visuals that add delight and joy.

✂️ 🌹 

- Performance, performance, performance
- Doesn't yet support all the features of Adobe After Effect
- Debugging can be challenging

---

<Image src="static/with-great-power-gif.gif" size="90%" />

<Notes>
So, I hope I’ve sold you on why you should at least give Lottie a try if you aren’t already doing so.
</Notes>

---

To summarize,

- Use animations to add additional context
- Use  animations to delight your users
- Use animations to give your product a body language
- Use animations to give your brand character
- Use animations only when it makes sense

---

Lottie can help you with all of these and more!

Questions?

<Notes>
